Horiseon Refactoring

As a marketing agent, I was assigned to develop a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that the website is more optimized. In order to complete this I removed redundancies and added proper semantics to html and CSS.
I also aded alt elements so that the image can be detailed.

The purpose of updating the webpage is to provide clean code and to make it more accessible.
